			<h1>Welcome to Weight Watchers Very Light</h1>
			<p>  Statistics have shown that one of the best ways to lose weight is to actually write down what you eat.
            Weight Watchers very light (WWVL) makes that process a little easier.
            </p>
            <p>  Store the foods you eat and the different portions they come in along with calorie information.
                Mix and Match them to store your favorite recipes.  Then just track what you eat on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>  WWVL also allows you to store your current weight to track your progress. We suggest once a week</p>
            <p>  Finally we provide you with a summary of your calorie daily intake so you can see how you are doing against your goals.  We also provide 5 and 10 day rolling averages for you as well.
            These measures are a better guide because they don't punish you so severely for the occasional splurge. If you can't treat yourself now and then you are much less likely to maintain your diet.
            Working to keep your rolling averages under your daily calorie goals is a good way to allow you to do that and still lose weight.  </p>
